# AirNES

**AirNES** is an open source air console that allows players to instantly turn their PC into a game console, using their smartphones and joysticks. It leverages the **Peer.js** library for LAN connectivity between host and players.

## Play now!

You don't need to install anything to play!

Just go to [nes.cosas.ar](https://nes.cosas.ar) from any device to host or join a game.

## Features

- **Peer-to-Peer LAN connection:** Connect to the host just by joining the same static webpage and being on the same Wi-Fi network.
- **Touch-Friendly Controller:** Fully interactive on mobile devices with touch controls.
- **ROM Upload and Management:** Upload any ROM and have them always at hand.
- **Cross-Device Play:** Works on both desktop and mobile devices, either as host or as player.

## Installation

To run **AirNES** locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/forbenaj/AirNES.git
   cd AirNES
   
2. Run the `index.html` in a local server. You can use the Live Server extension in VS Code.

3. From the devices that will be used as joysticks (usually smartphones), you can join the server by entering your IPV4 and the port number.

**AirNES** runs directly in the browser, so no additional setup or installation is required. Ensure all devices are in the same network.

   - Once the ROM is loaded, click "Start Emulator" to begin the game.
